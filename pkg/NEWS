Version 1.0-4: 2011-10-15
  * Added hooks introduced in R 2.11.0 (cap & raster dummy entry points)
Version 1.0-3: 2011-07-23
  * Added NAMESPACE
Version 1.0: 2008-10-12
  * Removed reference to type NewDevDesc in src/devSVG.c, which is disappearing in R.2.8.0
  * Tool tips can now be added to text (due to Charles Berry)
Version 0.7-5: 2008-09-10
  * Set default font-family to "Arial, sans-serif" for both text in plot
    and in tooltips
  * Adjust font widths to be correct for Arial in FireFox under Ubuntu
    (these will be incorrect if the the font-family is changed.)
  * Text in a plot now has color and font-family (due to David Reiss)
  * Default plot size is now 7 x 7 inches
  * Tweaked nominal char size to make axis labels print OK in simple plots
Version 0.7-4: 2008-02-17
  * Improve the font width data so that strwidth() is much more accurate.
    (It should be usable now, at least for standard characters in the
     standard font set.)
    Unfortunately, the widths appear to depend on the viewer -- the onese
    in the package are correct for SVG displayed in FireFox under Ubuntu.
    However, FireFox under Windows displays fonts with different widths,
    so these widths are still wrong in some viewers.
  * Add examples to man/RSVGTipsDevice.Rd to test character alignment
    and width calculations
  * In text, write out space as the XML entity "&#160;" so that
    multiple whitespace will be displayed verbatim rather than
    being collapsed to a single whitespace by the SVG renderer.
  * Call the exported R_GE_str2col() (new in R-2.6.0) instead of the
    unexported Rf_str2col(), which caused build warnings
  * Many improvements in src/devSVG.c to make more compatible with
    new features of R devices, due to Prof Brian Ripley.
  * Added ability for URLs to have a target (use _blank to cause
    a link to open in a new window)
  * Substitute for special characters in URLs and targets in
    setSVGShapeURL()
Version 0.7-3: 2007-09-06
  * Replace special characters <>&'" by their XML entity (&lt; etc.)
    in setSVGShapeToolTip() (and add extra arg sub.special=TRUE to
    this function to allow inhibiting this substitution).  Do the
    same for the label in text().
Version 0.7-1: 2007-06-12
  * small change to SVG code to make it display tips in more browsers
  * added options to control font size and opacity in tips
Version 0.7-0: 2007-04-30
  * based on RSvgDevice version 0.6.1 by T Jake Luciani <jakeluciani@yahoo.com>
  * supports line types (dotted, dashed, etc.)
  * supports one and two line tool tips
  * supports hyperlinks on shapes
  * fixes a potential buffer overflow problem in the C code
